# Even Better Repo
A better implementation of a repository for themes &amp; plugins for BetterDiscord

# THIS PLUGIN IS CURRENTLY UNMAINTAINED.
NO FUTURE WORK IS PLANNED, AND IT MAY BECONE INCOMPATIBLE WITH DISCORD AS NEW UPDATES COME OUT.
This also means we will not be adding new themes & plugins.
Feel free to fork and update if you wanr to. Â Ee will watch pull requests and merge if they fix compatibility issues.

## How To Install
1. Install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) if you don't already have it.
2. Download [evenBetterRepo.plugin.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRDeNial/BD-Even-Better-Repo/master/evenBetterRepo.plugin.js)
3. Put it in your plugins directory (Just open it from the client, can vary between users).
4. Restart BetterDiscord
5. Go into the BetterDiscord settings and enable the plugin
6. Restart betterDiscord

## How To Use
1. Go into your Discord settings.
2. On the left side column, you will see two new areas ("Plugins" and "Themes").
3. Select the repository you wish to explore
4. Click "Install" on the theme or plugin that you wish to use.
    * If the theme or plugin is already installed, you will see an update button instead

## To Add Your Theme/Plugin To The Repo
Due to the underlying conflicts in Git's pull request streamline, managing too many will become extremely tedious.
From this point, please submit "Issues" with the content that you want added using the following template:
```
Title: Repo Update - Theme/Plugin - Name

Theme/Plugin Name: `TYPE HERE`
Theme/Plugin Author: `TYPE HERE`
Theme/Plugin Repo URL: `TYPE HERE`

## To Do List
* Make theme & plugin list look better (ebr.css)
* Add actual version checking so users won't always see an update button if there is no update
* More error catching!
